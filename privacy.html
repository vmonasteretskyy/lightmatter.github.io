                    <p>
                        How we collect and store information depends on the pages you are visiting, the activities in
                        which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to
                        provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our Website, request
                        certain features, such as e-mail newsletters or when you make a payment. Like most

                        electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors and Users. For example, we may log
                        the name of your Internet Service Provider.

                        individualised content. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with
                        anyone, except in cases when that proves necessary.

                    <p>
                        We will retain the information we collect from you for a period of maximum of 5 /five/ years,
                        or less if it is no longer necessary for the provision of the DappDetect services to you. After
